Hi! I'm a french/portuguese graduate student, currently studying in
[[https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/][Sorbonne Universit√©]]'s [[https://sciences.sorbonne-universite.fr/en/formation-sciences/masters/master-informatique/parcours-IQ][Quantum Information]] Master's degree. Before
that, I went to [[https://univ-psl.eu][PSL]]'s [[https://cpes.univ-psl.eu][CPES]], an amazing multidisciplinary undergraduate
degree. I am interested in most things Mathematics, Computer Science,
Quantum Information, Economics and Philosophy.

This blog hosts some of my thoughts, posts and course notes. I will
also keep tabs on interesting articles I find in the web, books I've
read and movies I've seen.

I also dabble in photography: mainly street photography; but also
urban architecture and portraits, sometimes. I shoot mostly on film,
on a lovely Mamiya RZ67, but for protests I prefer digital. You can
find some of my photos on my [[https://flickr.com/photos/hugo-abreu][flickr]].

For more information, you can take a look at my CV in [[file:./home.org][About]].
